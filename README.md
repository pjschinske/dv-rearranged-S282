# Rearranged S282

This is a Derail Valley mod that changes the [wheel arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_arrangement) of the S282 locomotive.

It can convert the S282 into any of these:
- 4-4-0 American
- 4-4-2 Atlantic
- 4-4-4 Reading
- 4-6-0 Ten-wheeler
- 4-6-2 Pacific
- 0-8-0 Eight-wheel switcher
- 0-8-2
- 0-8-4
- 2-8-0 Consolidation
- 2-8-2 Mikado (which I've altered the look of, although you can switch it back to the vanilla look in the mod's settings)
- 2-8-4 Berkshire
- 2-8-0 High-speed Consolidation
- 2-8-2 High-speed Mikado
- 2-8-4 High-speed Berkshire
- 4-8-0 Twelve Wheeler
- 4-8-2 Mountain
- 4-8-4 Northern
- 0-10-0 Ten-wheel switcher
- 0-10-2 Union
- 0-10-4
- 2-10-0 Decapod
- 2-10-2 Santa Fe
- 2-10-4 Texas
- 4-10-0 Mastodon
- 4-10-2 Southern Pacific
- 4-10-4
- 0-12-0 Twelve-wheel switcher
- 2-12-0
- 2-12-2
- 4-12-2 Union Pacific
- 2-4-4-2
- 4-4-4-4

## Locomotives with altered driver size

Version 1.1.0 has added new wheel arrangements where the drive wheels and valve gear have been scaled up or down. In the future, I *might* make custom valve gear with the correct animations and proportions, but for now you'll have to deal with the cursed valve gear.

- All *x*-4-*x* locomotives have 82 inch drive wheels (~40% bigger)
- All *x*-6-*x* locomotives have 72 inch drive wheels (~30% bigger)
- The high-speed 2-8-2 Mikado has 67 inch drive wheels (~20% bigger)
- All *x*-12-*x* locomotives have 48 inch drive wheels (~15% smaller)

All others (including the duplexes) have the stock 56 inch drive wheels.

## How does it work?

This mod doesn't rely on Custom Car Loader. Instead, it copies and pastes parts of the existing S282 at runtime and moves them around.

For the locomotives with different sized drive wheels, I'm just scaling the drive wheels and valve gear.

I'm also altering the physics of the locomotive for the different wheel arrangements. Locomotives with a higher axle load on the drivers (from having either fewer drivers, or fewer leading/trailing wheels) will wheelslip easier. Locomotives with larger drivers will have a higher top speed but less tractive effort. Locomotives with smaller wheels will have more tractive effort but a lower top speed.

I've had to alter the mesh of the S282 around the firebox to get rid of some clipping with the fifth drive wheels. This mod automatically extracts the mesh from the game files using [a fork of AssetStudio](https://github.com/aelurum/AssetStudio). It then loads the mesh back into the game and alters the mesh. It then swaps out the existing S282 mesh for the altered mesh every time an S282 spawns in.

## Will you add other wheel arrangements?

The wheel arrangements listed above are the only ones I could find that looked vaguely plausible on the S282.

All others either:
- would look too strange
	- 2-6-0, 2-4-0, 4-14-4, etc.
- or would take too much effort to add to the game
	- e.g. triplexes

## Nerdy details about the wheel arrangement names

You may not agree with the names of the wheel arrangements I've given. I've tried to give the names that were historically most commonly used in the US. **There was no official standard for the names**, so there are multiple correct names for many classes. Many railroads didn't use any of these names, instead making up their own class designations.

Some people call a 4-8-0 a Mastodon, or a 4-4-0 an Eight-wheeler, or a 4-10-2 an Overland. These names were used, but were not as common in the US as the names I've listed here. For instance, 4-8-0's were usually only called Mastodon's by the Central Pacific Railroad, and almost everyone else called them Twelve Wheelers, so I've picked the name "Twelve Wheeler".

Southern Pacific and Union Pacific both made 4-10-2's, and had different names for the class. Southern Pacific made more of them, so I'm using their designation of "Southern Pacific" rather than Union Pacific's name of "Overland".

Then we get to the names of the 0-*x*-0 classes. Some historical sources call these *x*-coupled, as in six-coupled or eight-coupled. But often they also use these names for other classes as well. So "eight-coupled" might also be used for 2-8-0's and 2-8-2's. As far as I can tell, *x*-coupled really just means "it's got *x* drive wheels, all coupled together." So a 4-8-0 is an eight-coupled, but a 4-4-4-4 isn't.

I thought about calling the 0-8-4 a "Forney eight-coupled", but this mod's 0-8-4 looks nothing like a real Forney, despite sharing the same wheel arrangement.

## Building the code

To build the code, open the project in Visual Studio and go to "Build" > "Build Solution", then fix any missing library errors that may have popped up.

## Packaging the custom meshes

To repackage the new custom meshes (for the Franklin valve gear), more effort is needed. You will need:

- Autodesk Inventor
- Blender
- Unity 2019.4.40f1
- Visual Studio

The workflow is like this:
1. Parts are modelled in Autodesk Inventor (I know it's weird but it works for me)
2. In Inventor, export an OBJ file.

    Here are the options I used, but you can experiment until you're happy with the level of detail and the number of triangles.
    - Units: meter
	- Surface deviation: 36%
	- Normal deviation: 28
	- Max edge length: 100%
	- Aspect ratio: 21.5
3. In Blender, import the OBJ, do the UV mapping, and export a new OBJ

    To do the texture mapping in Blender:
    1. Import the OBJ file, then give it the locomotive texture
    2. Go into Edit Mode
	3. press 'a' to select all vertices
	4. press 'u' and select 'Smart UV Project'
	5. increase the island margin to about 0.03
	6. Go into the UV Editor and move the triangles around until the part looks good
	7. Save your work and export the new part as another OBJ file

4. Copy the new OBJ file with the UV mapping into the folder `s282_drivetrain\ExportedProject\Assets\Mesh`

5. In Unity, open the project in the s282_drivetrain folder.
   If all you're doing is updating an existing mesh, your new OBJ file will automatically load in.
   If not, you'll need to add the new part in.
6. Drag any updated prefabs from the Hierarchy tab to the Project tab under the "Prefabs" folder.
7. Right click in the "project" area, then select "Build AssetBundles".
8. Now you can go into Visual Studio and build the mod with your changes. When you build, it will automatically fetch the new AssetBundles that you just generated in Unity.
